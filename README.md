#Plant Pal
By Matthew Amorelli and Chantelle Cabanilla

#An small soil-moisture monitoring system that runs on the Arduino Mega 2560. It would have multiple states like Disabled, Idle, Dry, and Error, plus a start/reset button with an interrupt. It uses a moisture sensor, LEDs to show the current state, an LCD for messages, and an RTC to log when state changes happen.
